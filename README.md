# A Focused Analysis of Theater-based Kickstarter Campaigns
### Module 1 of UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp

## Overview

This project focused on performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in theater-based crowdfunding campaigns. The requester was "Louise," someone who was considering starting her own crowdfunding campaing to support a play they were producing. The primary tool used was Microsof Excel. The source data was a table of 4114 campaigns from 2010 through 2017, sourced with a bias towards theater campaigns, but sampling from a range of other categories as well. The methods used included pivot tables, break-out tables of subsets of data, charts of various critera, and various statistical formulae.

## General rates of successful campaigns

Out of over 900 US-based theater-related Kickstarter campaigns, over half were successfully funded, with just over one-third failures (did not meet fundraising goals). Out of the 671 campaigns for plays, over 60% were successful, also with roughly one-third failures. 

## Timing

Most sucessful campaigns are launched in May or June of the year. This trend is even more pronounced in the category of theater-related campaigns. The worst month for launching a theater (or any crowdfunding campaign, really) is December. People are probably saving their money for holiday shopping.
